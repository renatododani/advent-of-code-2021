#🎄 Advent of Code 2021

The Advent of Code challege have always been an opportunity for me to try a new language. The problems are difficult, but not impossible. I find each challenge also inadvertently introduces me to a new concept in the language, further helping me explore topics and best practices.

Back in 2016 I learned the F# language with the Advent of Code Challenge. This year, I decided to learn Rust.
